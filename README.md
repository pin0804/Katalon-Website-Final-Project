# Katalon Website Final Project - Online Shopping

## Objective

This project serves as the final project assignment for a self-paced bootcamp. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in web automation testing using Katalon Studio. The target website for testing is [https://www.advantageonlineshopping.com/#/](https://www.advantageonlineshopping.com/#/).

## Test Cases

The following tasks have been automated as test cases:

1. **Verify Homepage**:
   - Purpose: Verify the user interface (UI) of the homepage according to specifications.

2. **See Offer from Special Offer**:
   - Purpose: Navigate to the special offer page and verify the offers available.

3. **Send Form Contact Us**:
   - Purpose: Fill out and submit the "Contact Us" form.

4. **Verify Add to Cart (From Category Page)**:
   - Purpose: Add a product to the cart from the category page and verify the cart contents.

5. **Login Invalid (Account Not Registered)**:
   - Purpose: Attempt to log in with invalid credentials (account not registered) and verify the error message.

6. **TC - Import Jira (Expected Error)**:
   - Purpose: Attempt to import a Jira issue (expected to fail as the script for this feature is not available).

## Test Suite

There is one test suite named "Online Shopping Tests" that includes all test cases except for "TC - Import Jira." This test suite is designed to cover various aspects of the online shopping website.

## Note

Please note that the testing conditions assume that the user is not logged in. The test cases mentioned above are focused on different functionalities of the website, including UI verification, interaction with forms, and error handling.

Feel free to explore the test cases and the test suite in the project for a deeper understanding of the automation testing approach.
