# Katalon Website Final Project - Online Shopping

## Purpose
This project serves as an independent project assignment during the bootcamp. The goal is to demonstrate the automation testing skills acquired during the bootcamp on a real-world web application.

## Website Under Test
- **Website**: [Advantage Online Shopping](https://www.advantageonlineshopping.com/#/)

## Automation Tasks
The tasks being automated in this project are as follows:

1. **Verify Homepage**: Verify the user interface (UI) of the homepage to ensure it matches the expected design.

2. **See Offer from Special Offer**: Navigate to the "Special Offer" section and validate the offers displayed.

3. **Send Form Contact Us**: Fill out and submit the "Contact Us" form and confirm that it behaves as expected.

4. **Verify Add to Cart**: From the category page, verify the functionality of the "Add to Cart" button.

5. **Login Invalid**: Test the scenario where an invalid login is attempted (account not registered) and ensure the appropriate error message is displayed.

6. **TC - Import Jira**: Import Jira test case data. Note that this test case is expected to fail because the script has not been created.

## Test Suites
This project contains one test suite that encompasses all the test cases mentioned above, except for "TC - Import Jira." The test suite is designed to cover essential functionalities of the Advantage Online Shopping website.

## Testing Note
Please note that the testing conditions assume that the user is not logged in. These test cases aim to validate the behavior of the website from the perspective of a **non-logged-in** user.
